# CTF Write Ups
## I specialize in Web and Mobile


## These Write-Ups are meant to be Authentic!
- You'll stumble on many dead ends that I also stumbled upon
	- I won't delete subparagraphs relating to me getting lost

- I won't hide that I received hints, asked and managed to solve issue with my team-mate, or that I read an article, watched Youtube video

- **This repo is not meant to show how great hacker I am, to imitate my skills, to prove them**
	- It's simply to show that I am learning, constantly challenging myself
	- Not being in a bubble outside of Impostor Syndrome

### Will these Write-Ups be messy then?
- I hope not!
- I'll organize these write-ups to have a good structure
	- But don't expect me to cover everything that doesn't relate to **specifically solving** the challenge
