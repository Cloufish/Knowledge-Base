# What Most Blog Websites Lacks
## 1. Proper Structure
### Articles that are being forgotten / Not being reviewed
Most of the Articles should be reviewed at least once a year. In Reality, so many authors don't care, and Publish blog post just for the sake of publishing,  and building your online presence (myself included)

I can publish an introductory course on Kubernetes, or on IT Security Monitoring. But what will come out of it If I don't  make them... more readable each month/year?

### Articles that aren't built on each other
- The blog-posts should get built on each other. 
- Should be referencing one topic that is in another blog-post

If there won't be any topics developing already written ones, you, as a reader will end up retrieving the same information over and over again. This just wastes your time
