# Practicality MOC
The main purpose of this section is to provide good quality Practical Knowledge. That advances the reader in **Bypassing Filters, WAFs**;
Sharpens his skills and actually makes him do the Challenges by yourself reading these Write-Ups.
You, as a reader, will be positioned in Attacker's position, Observer's Position and Defender's Position at the same time 
**CTFs will be authentic, with good explanation provided, and directions given** 
**^ These are the Principles I want to follow**, see [[How I Write CTF Write-Ups]]
