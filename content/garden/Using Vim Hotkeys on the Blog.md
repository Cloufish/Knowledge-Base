# Using Vim Hotkeys on the Blog
The **Gatsby-Digital-Garden** Theme provides a minimalistic structure, that **won't neccesarily require using your mouse** and **you can easily read it only with Keyboard**.

**You can accomplish that by** installing [Vimium Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).

**After you install the Extension**, press `f` key to open View that shows you all possible **hyperlinks**

Now by clicking a key on the particular hyperlink, you will be 'transfered' into this hyperlink, give it a try!
